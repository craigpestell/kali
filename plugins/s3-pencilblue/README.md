S3 PencilBlue
==

A plugin that allows for S3 to be the media storage for the platform.

First and foremost:  If at any point you have questions, comments or concerns you can find us hanging out on 
twitter [@getpencilblue](https://twitter.com/GetPencilBlue) and on our 
[Sub-Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/domain/pencilblue.org/).  We're always happy to help and pull requests (plugin 
or core) are always welcome. 

Installation:

1) Clone repo into your PencilBlue's **plugins** directory.

2) Edit your **config.json** file to configure the media provider
```
{
  "media": {
    "provider": "/plugins/s3-pencilblue/include/s3_media_provider.js"
  }
}
```
3) Start or restart your PB instance

4) Navigate to **Manage Plugins** section in PencilBlue

5) Install the **s3-pencilblue** plugin

6) Upon successful install click the **Settings** button for the s3-pencilblue plugin

7) Enter your S3 **Access Key**, **Secret Access Key** and **Bucket** name

8) Optionally, enter your **region**.

9) Click **Save**

You should be good to go!

**NOTE:**
Currently there is no way to migrate data from one media provider to the other.  If "uploaded" media already exists 
that was created from a different provider then you must delete it and upload it.  You will also have to re-link any 
system objects that rely on that media until you can replace the content for a media object.  See
